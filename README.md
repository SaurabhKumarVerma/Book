## Feature

- This project is an application that searches and reviews a large library of books for users to peruse. With the help of the Google Books API, users may look up books by title, author, or keyword and get detailed information about each one, such as synopses, biographies of the authors, and reviews that have been published.<br>.
- This application's integration of Google Authentication is one of its primary features. Users may ensure a smooth and customised experience by safely logging in with their Google accounts. After completing the authentication process, users can utilise the entire app's features, including interacting with the book catalogue, writing reviews, and bookmarking their favourite titles for later use. To ensure a seamless user experience, the application securely stores user authentication tokens using React Native Async Storage.<br>
- MobX, a potent and adaptable state management library for React apps, effectively manages the state of the application. MobX makes sure that data in the application moves between its various components in an orderly and consistent manner, giving the user a snappy and seamless experience.<br>
- Smooth surfing is ensured by the user interface's intuitive and user-friendly design. Readers may effortlessly peruse the search results, apply filters based on different parameters like genre, publication date, or rating, and obtain comprehensive details about every book, such as synopsis, cover art, and reader ratings. Smooth and fascinating animations driven by the well-known animation library Lottie are incorporated into the application to improve its visual appeal and user engagement.<br>
- Additionally, by letting users add their own evaluations and ratings for the books they've read, the app promotes community involvement. This tool not only helps book lovers connect with one another, but it also offers insightful information to other people who are thinking about starting a new book.<br>
- All things considered, this book search and review app combines the strength of the Google Books API with an intuitive user interface, Google Authentication, safe token storage provided by React Native Async Storage, effective state management from MobX, and elegant animations from Lottie to create a feature-rich and aesthetically pleasing platform for book enthusiasts to find, read, and discuss their literary experiences.<br>
